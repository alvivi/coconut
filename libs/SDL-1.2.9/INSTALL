To install and use SDL:

    1a. If you are compiling SDL applications natively, you can install
        the SDL development files by typing "make native"

    1b. If you are cross-compiling from Linux to Win32, and you have your
        cross-compiler installed /usr/local/cross-tools as described in:
            http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/README.txt
        You can install the SDL development files by typing "make cross"

    2.  Look at the example programs in ./test, and check out the HTML
        documentation in ./docs to see how to use the SDL library.

    3.  Join the SDL developer mailing list by sending E-mail to
    	sdl-request@libsdl.org
        and put "subscribe" in the subject of the message.

        Or alternatively you can use the web interface:
            http://www.libsdl.org/mailing-list.php

That's it!
